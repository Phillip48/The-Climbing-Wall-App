## Usage

**User Story**

As the user I want to track my climbing progress with a mobile app. This should allow me to create, read, upload and delete projects and sends. I also want to see my stats like total send and attempts, as well as max bouldering and top roping grades. Other stats include a graph of all sends and a heatmap to show days climbed.
